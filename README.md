# Problem Statement : Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis on Socio-Economic Status of the local population of Chetla-Tollugunj Area, Kolkata
# Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge from data sets that are typically huge in amount. The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statics, information visualization, graphic, and business.
# What is a Data Science Pipeline?
A pipeline in data science is “a set of actions which changes the raw (and unorganised) data from various sources (surveys, feedbacks, list of purchases, votes, etc.), to an understandable format so that we can store it and use it for analysis.
# The raw data undergoes different stages within a pipeline which are: 
# Fetching/Obtaining the Data :
This stage involves the identification of data from the internet or internal/external databases and extracts into useful formats. 
# Scrubbing/Cleaning the Data :
This stage involves examining the data, identifying errors , missing values and replacing or filling those missing values.
# Exploratory Data Analysis : 
When data reaches this stage of the pipeline, it is free from errors and missing values, and hence is suitable for finding patterns using visualizations and charts. 
# Modeling the Data : 
This is that stage of the data science pipeline where machine learning comes to play. With the help of machine learning, we can create data models which are used as a predictive tool to enhance our business decision-making. 
# Interpreting the Data :
Similar to paraphrasing a data science model. This is the most crucial stage of the pipeline, where with the use of psychological techniques, correct business domain knowledge and storytelling abilities, we can explain our model to the non-technical audience. 
# Revision :
As the nature of the business changes, there is the introduction of new features that may degrade your existing models. Therefore, periodic reviews and updates are very important from both business’s and data scientist’s point of view.
